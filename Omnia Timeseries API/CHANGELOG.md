# Omnia Timeseries API changelog

All notable changes to this API will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [v1.7 (Beta)]
### Added
-  Federation, new concept, new optional parameter federationSource on some endpoints
-  Federation, new endpoint
  * https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-beta-v1-7/operations/getDataByName?
- New endpoints for streaming
- New endpoint to read metadata change history

### Changed
- General improvements and error corrections

## [v1.6]
### Added
- Response encoded in Protobuf added as an option for the following data points (/data) endpoints:
  * https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-v1-6/operations/getDatapoints?
  * https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-v1-6/operations/get-aggregates?
  * https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-v1-6/operations/getMultiDatapoints?
  * https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-v1-6/operations/getFirstDatapoint?
  * https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-v1-6/operations/getFirstMultiDatapoint?
  * https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-v1-6/operations/getLatestDatapoint?
  * https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-v1-6/operations/getLastMultiDatapoint?
- Added "Facility" as a mandatory new metadata field when creating a new timeseries object (https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-v1-6/operations/postTimeseries?). The facility field shall represent the plant code the timeseries belongs to. Only valid facility codes according to Equinor Common Library (master data) will be accepted. If an invalid facility code is sent in the body, a **"400 Bad Request" is returned with the message "Facility not found."**
- Enhanced access control where we are able to control the access on source (e.g. Historian) across plants and on both source and plant (e.g. Historian from Ã…sgard B). This works both for both OAuth 2.0 grant flows (service-to-service and user impersonation).
- Support for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) [minor v1.6.1] 
- Improved authorization to data from other sources than historian/IMS [minor v1.6.1]
- New endpoint to add or get multiple timeseries objects: [minor v1.6.2  
  * https://api.equinor.com/docs/services/Timeseries-api-v1-6/operations/postGetOrAddTimeseries


### Removed
- Metadata (name and unit) removed from the response returned from all data point endpoints (/data), you will only get the timeseries id and VQT (value, quality, timestamp).

### Changed
- You are not allowed to create a timeseries metadata object with the same name on the same facility. A **"409 Conflict" with the message "Attempt to store timeseries 'name' from 'facility' which already exists"**. In version 1.5 the constraint was on the fields "name + assetId".
- Creating a new timeseries object in Omnia Timeseries API v1.6 with facility = "XXX" where a timeseries already exists with the same name and assetId = "XXX" will return a **"409 Conflict" with the message "Attempt to store timeseries 'name' from 'facility' which already exists"**.
- The "facility" field is now mandatory as opposed to "assetId" in v1.5 that was optional. 
- Error message response, tracedID returned instead of activityID. [minor v.1.6.2]

### Fixed
- Various backend tuning to improve the performance.

## [v1.5]
### Added
- Added support for retrieves datapoints from multiple timeseries (max 100) in one request.
- Added a new field "metadata" that can be used to add custom metadata on a timeseries (key,value pairs).
- Both afterTime and beforeTime (bounds) now optional parameters when getting the first datapoint.
- Both afterTime and beforeTime (bounds) now optional parameters when getting the last datapoint.
- Added support for filtering on datapoint status on both raw and aggregated timeseries data.
- The return limit for data points is now increased to 100 000.

## [v1.4]
### Added
- Added support to authenticate on behalf of a user and authorize based on AD group membership. Only for users with Equinor accounts.
- New endpoint for deleting timeseries data points and timeseries metadata objects

## [v1.3]
### Added
- Writing timeseries data points using HTTP POST on one or multiple timeseries, with the option of choosing it to be asynchronous or not.
- Wildcard (using asterisk) search on the timeseries metadata fields name, description and unit, and now support for starting the search with asterisk
- Filtering on multiple fields in timeseries list

## [v1.2]
### Added
- Get aggregated timeseries data (avg, min, max, sum, stddev, count) according to time window, processing interval and filling of empty processing intervals.
- Wildcard (using asterisk) search on timeseries name (currently not supporting searches starting with asterisk)

## [v1.1]
### Added
- Create one timeseries metadata object
- Partial update of one timeseries metadata object
- Full update of one timeseries metadata object
- Retrieve one timeseries metadata object by id
- Retrieve a list of all timeseries, or a subset based on one of the query parameters: name, externalId or assetId
- Retrieve raw data points (timeseries data) within a given time window (id, startTime, endTime)
- Include outside data points (left and right outside points)
- Retrieve first data point of a timeseries
- Retrieve latest data point of a timeseries
- Support for paging (by continuation token) on both timeseries metadata and timeseries data
